X.TH TYPETOD 6 typetod\-VERSION
X.SH NAME
Xtypetod \- type everything forever
X.SH SYNOPSIS
Xtypetod [\-a <attribute>] [\-c] [\-d] [\-e] [\-f] [\-l <character>] [\-m] [\-n]
X[\-q] [\-r] [\-s] [\-t <integer>] [\-w]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
Xtypetod is a typing game which has four modes; fortune mode (default), files
Xmode, RSS feeds mode, and stdin mode. And, with the first three modes, you can
Xplay with its endless mode. You can exit a game or leave from the screen
Xanywhere typing an escape key or ctrl + e. On the menu screen, you can moves
Xthe cursor downwards typing j and upwards typing k, and play a game with the
Xcontent of the selected title typing space or enter key. typetod is executed as
Xfollows.
X.TP
Xtypetod
Xfortune mode. Benefitial tips from fortune command are as samples.
X.TP
Xtypetod <file> [<file>...]
Xfiles mode. Text files which are local or remote (passed as URLs with http or
Xftp scheme) as samples.
X.TP
Xtypetod -f <url_to_rss_feed>
XRSS feeds mode. the artilcles in a RSS feed as samples.
X.TP
X<command> | typetod
Xstdin mode. In this mode, typetod reads lines one by one from stdin adding it
Xto the buffer of samples during the game. To enable this mode, use pipes on the
Xcommand line.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.TP
X.B \-a <attribute>
Xsets the attribute of characters which is mistyped. Valid arguments are
X\'reverse\' (default), \'blink\', \'bold\', \'underline\', and \'normal\'.
X.TP
X.B \-c
Xchanges the unit of typing speed to cps. The default is wpm.
X.TP
X.B \-d
Xenables endless mode which is valid only with fortune mode, files mode, and RSS
Xfeeds mode.
X.TP
X.B \-e
Xremoves empty lines from your sample texts. It should remove all of them that
Xcan be generated by not only sample texts, but typetod itself to distinguish
Xeach of them from the others.
X.TP
X.B \-f
Xswitches the game mode to RSS feeds mode. You also specify one url to the RSS
Xfeed as the command argument.
X.TP
X.B \-l <character>
Xsets the character used by typetod for drawing two lines right next to the
Xinput line.
X.TP
X.B \-m
Xtoggle display of menu screen.
X.TP
X.B \-n
Xenables the feature of morphing text. This can be removed in the next version
Xwhen it seems to be not popular.
X.TP
X.B \-q
Xmakes it quiet without any result screen and status bar.
X.TP
X.B \-r
Xenable you to specify directories as arguments on files mode. typetod will
Xsearch the directories to find files in them by one level.
X.TP
X.B \-s
Xdisable the status bar.
X.TP
X.B \-t <integer>
Xsets the number of spaces per tab. typetod always converts all tabs of samples
Xand input characters into spaces.
X.TP
X.B \-w
Xconverts multiple space to one space and erase spaces at the beginnning of the
Xline.
X.SH NOTES
XThis program depends on the
X.I feedparser
Xpackage of python.
