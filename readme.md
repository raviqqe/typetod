## What is typetod?
typetod is a typing game that works on a terminal. It has four modes;

* fortune mode
* files mode
* RSS feeds mode
* stdin mode

When you choose stdin mode or others with -d option, typetod becomes endless
mode. It lets you type forever. And, typetod also evaluate your typing speed
and accuracy.

## Game modes
### fortune mode
  It takes benefitial tips from fortune command as samples.
### files mode
  Text files which are local or remote (http and ftp allowed as url schemes) as
  samples.
### RSS feeds mode
  If you specify the url of a RSS feed, items of the feed will appear on your
  screen. Then, you can select one of them as a sample.

  In this mode, typetod reads lines one by one from stdin adding it to the
  buffer of samples during the game. You can use a pipe to do that.
